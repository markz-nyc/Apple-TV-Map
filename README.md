# Apple-TV-Map

This TV Map developed based on Mapkit to show user local traffic condition and weather info. User can choose different map type from standard, satelite and birdview. Long press the remote center to focus on the uibutton.
I have google map and apple map version, google map can run on xcode simulator, but failed to submit to itunes, since Google map ios sdk doens't support tvos now.
You need to replace your own forecast.io API key in app to get weather info.
